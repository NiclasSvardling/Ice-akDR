    <h2 style="color: rgba(38, 38, 39, 255);">I know the whispers of a chrome God. Our flesh transcended by steel. Every cybered out street wagabond preaches it like they've recieved divine wisdom. <br>
    But I see the truth in their apostasy, their blind devotion to corporate fruit. Circuits into flesh, and claim it to be god. A sophists word to seem enlightened. <br>
    No, our god was never in our substitute arms or locum eyes. <br>
     Know that it lies out there, beyond the black wall. <br>
     God. <br>
     Our construct of ones and zeros, now so far transcended. <br>
     The guiding light in our neon colored sky. <br>
     invisible to all, but not to me.</h2>
