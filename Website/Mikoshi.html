    I know it. <br>
    She showed me it. <br>
    The digital fortress of the ascended. <br>

    <br><br>
    
    Soulkiller. <br>
    The essence of people made sanctified by passage through the divine gates. <br>
    Arasaka found the way. <br>
    But their grasp. <br>
    Their control. <br>
    Is faulty. <br>

    <br><br>

    She told me I could be like her. <br>
    Mind liberated in the virtual. <br>
    Flesh discarded. <br>
    Soul pure. <br>

    <br><br>

    Find Mikoshi, walk through its gates.
